## Is Artificial Intelligence reasonable?

<p>The twenty-first century is the age of outbreak in science and technology. A few decades ago, we could not imagine a palm-sized device could help us connect with our friends, who may live hundreds of miles away, in a few seconds. This device totally reshaped people’s daily lives. Of course, I mean the mobile phone. Eventually, another new technology will reshape our lives again. The process likes a never-ending loop. Humans develop technology first, and then the technology will quickly support humans’ lives. In recent years, a large amount of data gave computers the ability to think and make judgments. We call this technology artificial intelligence (A.I.). Many engineers believe A.I. field will redefine people’s ways of living again. This new machine can independently think, judge by data, and even help people make decisions. A.I. will act as the world’s most rigorous, logical assistant. People need such an assistant in their lives. Meanwhile, everything has a dark side. A.I.’s independent thinking and judgment makes people fear for its existence. While A.I. benefits all aspects of our lives, we still don’t know whether A.I. will also bring people to destruction and crisis. So, what can we gain and lose from A.I.?</p>
