<p>An argument may arise when two or more individuals exchange opposing views, and arguments can hurt the people we care about. Normally, we take the matter to heart and may resent or even hold grudges. Hurt people also develop some chronic emotions. These emotions will accumulate and silently affect our health. Therefore, one key secret people usually ignore is how to deal with such hurt through forgiveness. Forgiveness helps heal our wounds, and people who forgive live longer.</p>

<p>First of all, there is a strong relationship between forgiveness and psychological well-being. Individuals that indulge in conditional forgiveness risk a reduced lifespan. Conditional forgiveness implies the person may only forgive the wrongdoer if they first apologize or promise not to repeat the transgression. However, apologizing is an essential step toward forgiveness. When saying sorry is brought in as a necessary condition, it limits the chances of the forgiveness process. The wrongdoer may not always fulfill such conditions and the offended individual makes the reconciliation process even harder.</p>

<p>The act of forgiving someone reduces anger. Whenever an individual is chronically angry, they are more likely to be in a state of flight. This aspect has a negative impact on the heart as it elevates an individual’s blood pressure. Forgiving decreases stress, hence tamping down the anger they had during the argument. Meanwhile, being disappointed and hurt can weigh heavily on a person causing them psychological, emotional, and physical stress. Refusing to forgive adds onto these burdens causing more sadness, anger, and feeling out of control.</p>

<p>Additionally, forgiveness has its health benefits. This health benefit of forgiveness is a reduction in the negative effects of health such as depression, anger, and feelings of tension. When a forgiving act occurs, the forgiver abandons the pursuit of revenge thus feeling less upset and angry. The negative effects of lack of forgiveness weigh heavily on the health of the individual due to the increased levels of emotions. The process of asking for forgiveness also helps the wrongdoers to forgive themselves in the process. Whenever an individual offends another, they are more likely to blame themselves and are in a situation that makes them feel it is okay for them to feel bad. This acts as a challenging barrier that makes people not forgive themselves. When individuals apologize for their wrongdoing, they feel free to let off the burden of mistakes they did, therefore, forgiving themselves in the process.</p>

<p>The act of forgiveness has positive effects on lowering blood pressure. This is true especially for people in a relationship who have had an argument. Forgiveness helped in reducing the blood pressure for each person. The wrongdoers typically have lower blood pressure than those who have offended. Forgiving others after an argument can save or even strengthen the relationship. The reconciliation aspect after a misunderstanding is important as it can also help people learn from each other. This way they will know each other’s points of view, likes, and dislikes. People who have successfully reconciled after an argument due to forgiveness can overcome the hurt and appreciate one another more.</p>

<p>It is impossible to avoid arguments whether at the office or at home. Arguments can lead to holding grudges, hate, resentment or even the urge to be vengeful. All these are considered unhealthy for the well-being of an individual and will further affect personal health. Human beings should practice a better way of resolving their hurt by forgiving one another.
